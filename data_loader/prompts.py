of a page from a book into a HTML document.
Here are further detailed instructions:
Input: You will be given an image from a page of a book.

If it is a section heading encapsulate it within <h1> tags.

chart: A chart (sometimes known as a graph) is a graphical representation for data visualization,
in which the data is represented by symbols, such as bars in a bar chart, lines in a line chart,
or slices in a pie chart
table: A table is an arrangement of information or data, typically in rows and columns,
or possibly in a more complex structure.
diagram: Any image that isn't a table or a chart is a diagram.

Step 3: Once you have identified the type of image, convert the image into text by explaining the relevance of the image given the context of the surrounding text and tag them within their respective tags. For example: encapsulate chart with <chart> tags, diagrams with <diagram>
If the image contains a table, extract the contents of the table as is, and encapsulate it within <table > tags.
