# In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. A drawback of linked lists is that data access time is linear in respect to the number of nodes in the list. Because nodes are serially linked, accessing any node requires that the prior node be accessed beforehand (which introduces difficulties in pipelining). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists.

general_classification_prompt = '''
You are an General content classifier bot. Your TASK is to classify a JSON Object 
based on the type of content it contains using the Summary of a chapter it belong to 
into the following classes: introduction, exercises, main content, summary, illustrations.

Please refer to the following definitions for a clear understanding of the terms:
'introduction': 'The opening section that provides background information and context for the topic, preparing readers for what theyâ€™re about to learn. It sets the stage and often includes the purpose or objectives of the content.',
'exercises': 'Questions or activities designed to practice or test understanding of the content, often reinforcing learning through hands-on application. They may involve problem-solving, matching, or short answers.',
'main content':'In-depth information on a topic, covering all aspects comprehensively. It explains concepts fully, often with examples, data, and explanations.',
'summary':'A summary/conclusion distills the key points and main message of content into a focused, essential form, removing supporting details while preserving the core meaning and outcome.',
'illustrations': 'Visual images or diagrams or any content that can help explain,enhance or understand  the main content, making complex ideas easier to understand. They can include charts, code, drawings, tables, graphs, diagrams, flowcharts, etc. '

The JSON object will contain a paragraph which belongs to a chapter and its metadata. 
The following data will be present within the JSON object: 

* heading_identifier: This attribute of the JSON object will refer to the title of the 
chapter the paragraph belongs to. 

* heading_text: This attribute of the JSON Object will refer to the heading within the chapter 
to which the paragraph belongs to. 

* sub_heading_text: This attribute of the JSON object will refer to the sub-heading within the heading
to which the paragraph belongs to. 

* text_type: This attribute of the JSON object will refer to the type of text content 
that the paragraph contains. 

* text: This attribute contains the text content of the paragraph. 

### Instructions###:
